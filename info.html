          My name is Aktan Zhakypbekov and I am an aspiring web developer. I
          created this website as a tribute to my favorite survival-horror game
          "Darkwood". It is a simple website and at the time of the writing made
          purely with HTML and CSS. But I have plans regarding interactivity
          with the Inventory and Characters parts and I am certainly going to be
          using Javascript for that. Talking about the game and the website - I
          cannot express with words how much I love this game so I believe you
          will understand it by looking at my work and the dedication I had for
          it. Darkwood is a surreal experience and you can best understand this
          game if you have some Eastern European/Russian/Slavic/Soviet
          background. I don't know about you, but as I was born and raised in a
          Soviet State, it is very dear to me as it invokes the memories of my
          childhood closely connected with that post-soviet context. Several
          games have the same effect, for example: Stalker, Metro, and several
          Russian/Slavic movies about Chernobyl. It is a feeling of not so
          distant past, warmth, mixed with some nostalgia, some fairy tales
          grandmothers used to tell about a dark forest filled with mystery and
          creatures, unexplainable, strange, has no evident start nor a
          reasonable conclusion. I could be talking about it for hours, but you
          should better play it yourself or/and hang out in my website.
